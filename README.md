# "What is this?" :
This repository is for the course CPSC 354 known as "Programming Language" where we
go over many theories of what Programming Language is to how it works behind the scene.

This course goes over a wide variety of topics ranging from Arithmetic to Theories. The aim
of this course is to understand how programming languages work under the hood with the possibility of 
designing our own programming language. In the end, the outcome of the course would lead to us being able to
understand the basic ideas of advance topics such as theorem proving, dependent types, and mathematics as a specification.
